## Algorithm
1.Initialize a variable smallest with the first element of the array.
2.Iterate through the array starting from the second element.
3.Compare each element with smallest.
4.If the current element is less than smallest, update ,smallest with the current element.
5.After the loop ends, smallest will contain the smallest number in the array.
## How to Run the Code
1.Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the terminal and navigate to the repository directory.
3. Compile the C++ code using:
